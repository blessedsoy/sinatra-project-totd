# sinatra-project-totd

This is a Sinatra web CRUD application for a forum called "TOTD", "Twitter/Topics Of The Day" which will have top 10 topics of the day from Twitter, and each topic has a page where you can write comments.

Twitter Trend Api was used in this app. (You need to have your own client key and token.)
